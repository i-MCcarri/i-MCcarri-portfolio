            <h2>About Me</h2> 
            <div class="gap-footer"></div>
            <section>
              <p>I grew up as the second of 9 children in a large blended family. As I got older my family grew to be more complicated. When my Mother married a Navy Seamen, I became a Military Brat and had the privilege of traveling the World. I found myself attending a DODEA secondary school in Naples, Italy just after the "Dotcom Bubble," where I studied HTML, CSS and C++. Since this was at the beginning of the Tech expansion, I unfortunately did not realize my elective hobby could have been a fulfilling career.
              </p>
          
              <p>In 2018 I was in a minor auto accident that resulted in some major injuries. These forced me to step away from my business and prioritize my recovery. In 2019 I resumed professional networking with ongoing clients and our acquaintances who worked for Amazon, Expedia and Google. They were very forthcoming and willing to share the day-to-day activities of a Software Developer with me. I quickly began to realize I was in the wrong industry! moreover, I already had a strong foot hold within the skill set necessary to make the switch.
              </p>
              <p>In August of 2019 I began a new chapter, seeking to meet my heart's longing. My aspirations lead me to Career Karma, where I found a fast track founded by an innovative CEO, Ruben Harris. After completing a profile questionnaire, I was given a Mentor, invited to behavior & technical coaching events and began a prep course to dust off my high school hobby. It was a good match with Thinkful, and I began to fulfill my dreams.
              </p>
              <p>I look Forward to working with you!</p>
